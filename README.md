Google Code Jam

## Name: ftech

## Below are listed the years and the corresponding exercises I participated:


# Code Jam 2020
    
- The link for the exercises: https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/archive/2020
(I didn't passed the qualification round, so it is the only one I participated).
The code for each exercise doesn't has comments, because of the limited time of the
competition. However, it's easy to understand the algorithm and to run the code.
Also, there are some samples to check that the code is running or not (by checking the
results with the vocalizations).

- The link for the exercises: #TODO
(I didn't passed the qualification round, because of work hours).
The above comments apply to 2021 first round too.
